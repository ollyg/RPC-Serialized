=head1 NAME

RPC::Serialized::Client::STDIO - RPC client using Standard I/O

=head1 VERSION

version 1.110470

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use RPC::Serialized::Client::STDIO;
  
 my $c = RPC::Serialized::Client::STDIO->new;
  
 my $result = $c->remote_sub_name(qw/ some data /);
     # remote_sub_name gets mapped to an invocation on the RPC server
     # it's best to wrap this in an eval{} block

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to communicate with an L<RPC::Serialized> server over
Standard Input and Standard Output.

You would not normally use this module directly, except perhaps for testing.
It might be more useful as a base class upon which to build another more
useful client.

For further information on how to pass settings into C<RPC::Serialized>, and
make RPC calls against the server, please see the L<RPC::Serialized> manual
page.

=head1 THANKS

This module is a derivative of C<YAML::RPC>, written by C<pod> and Ray Miller,
at the University of Oxford Computing Services. Without their brilliant
creation this system would not exist.
